# bxlETH

Our project was built using a combination of TypeScript/JavaScript, Solidity, and React to create a seamless multichain Ethereum staking platform. We developed TypeScript/JavaScript contracts and scripts to integrate with the NEAR protocol, enabling cross-chain compatibility and leveraging NEAR's chain signature technology for synchronizing the value of our liquid staking token, bxlETH, across different blockchains. We deployed test Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum network to facilitate staking, minting of bxlETH, and withdrawals, ensuring that our staking mechanisms function correctly. The frontend was built using React, providing a user-friendly interface for staking, managing, and withdrawing assets. The integration with NEAR involved using chain signatures to manage bxlETH value synchronization across multiple chains, ensuring consistent token valuation. This innovative approach, combined with the robust testing on Ethereum and the responsive React frontend, resulted in a versatile and user-friendly multichain staking platform that simplifies and enhances the staking experience across different blockchain ecosystems
